**Accessibility**
Web accessibility implies that websites, tools, or technology are created and developed so that persons with impairments can use them. More specifically, humans can:

- perceive, interpret, navigate, and engage with the Web
- contribute to the Web

**Visual Hierarchy**
Visual hierarchy refers to the arranging of components in ascending or descending order of importance. This is accomplished using proportion, color, images, contrast, typography, whitespace, texture, and style.

**Web Safe Fonts**
Use web-safe fonts

**Typography**
16px is the optimal font size

**Color**
Limit the color palette to no more than five hues. Complementary colors are effective.

**Grid Layouts**
Grids assist in structuring your design and organizing your information. The grid assists in aligning objects on the page and maintaining its cleanliness.

**F Pattern**
The F-based pattern is indeed the most often used pattern by visitors while scanning content on a website. According to eye-tracking research, most of what individuals view is in the top and left-hand corners of the screen.

**Responsive**
Responsive web design (RWD) is a web design method that strives to give the greatest viewing experience possible for site visitors across a wide variety of devices.

### Favicon

The Favicon ("Fav-icon") is a small image file that can be 16px X 16px, however Google development recommends multiples of 48px square.
Most web image file formats are supported, however, the preferred .ico format is what we will use in the course.
