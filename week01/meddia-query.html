            <h2>Mosiah 3:19</h2>
            <p>19 For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever
                and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and
                becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek,
                humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon
                him, even as a child doth submit to his father.</p>

                the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</p>
